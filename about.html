            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ashley, currently a student at Grand Circus, where I'm learning Full Stack C# development. I live in Downriver, Michigan, but I was born and raised in Southwest Detroit. My goal is to master both front-end and back-end web development, and use those skills to contribute to my community.

                Although I'm new to the coding world, I'm eager to learn and absorb as much knowledge as I can! Outside of my studies, I spend time with my husband, Hector, and our three adorable pets—Snoopy, Lyla, and Melanie. I also have a passion for drawing and painting. While I may not be Picasso, I’ve created some pieces that proudly hang on my mom’s fridge!
                                 </p>
